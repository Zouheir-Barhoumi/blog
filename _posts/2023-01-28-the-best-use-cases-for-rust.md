# The best use cases for Rust programming language

This post is about the best use cases for the Rust programming language.

Rust is a fairly new programming language that aims to provide high-performance, safe and reliable systems programming. It has gained popularity in recent years because it offers several advantages over other languages.

However, while it is easy to learn and implement, it’s not always obvious which applications are a good fit for Rust. In this post, I’m going to discuss the use cases where Rust is well-suited and highlight some benefits it provides.

## Application domains

### 1\. Concurrency

Most applications that require performance and scalability involve concurrency or parallelism, and this is where Rust shines.

Concurrency and parallelism are fundamental concepts in computer programming. They provide a way to create programs that run multiple tasks simultaneously. For example, most web servers use thread pools to perform background tasks such as database queries, image resizing or image processing.

While many languages can support concurrent programs, Rust is especially well-suited to the task because of its safe memory model, which prevents data races, and its built-in support for parallelism.

Some prominent examples of Rust code that uses concurrency include: live-coding an animation platform for developing games and interactive media, writing an IRC bot framework, and creating a procedurally generated strategy game.

### 2\. General-purpose

Another major advantage of Rust is that it supports both low-level and high-level programming. It has a sophisticated type system that allows developers to write expressive types and leverage them to reason about their programs.

This makes it easy to write modular, reusable and extendable code, which is instrumental in large software projects.

Rust is an ideal choice for developing embedded software thanks to various features. Its garbage collector allows it to be fast and efficient enough for real-time embedded systems. Its dynamic dispatch mechanism simplifies implementing network protocols (TCP/IP and UDP/IP).

## Implementation considerations

### 1\. Disadvantages of Rust

One of the main limitations of Rust is its poor performance compared to native C/C++ implementations without Intel’s Ivy Bridge or later processors.

The compiler requires one extra level of indirection to support generics, which makes loops more CPU-intensive.

Another limitation of Rust is that it doesn’t support native threads on 32-bit architectures, so all calls to Thread::spawn() require an unsafe block to be enclosed in the function definition.

In order to bypass this limitation, standard libc functions are one solution. However, this is not the most desirable option since those functions are OS-specific and lack certain features regular thread functions offer.

The Windows versions of Rust are still in the early stages of development, so the software currently available has several known bugs and limitations.

### 2\. Advantages of Rust

Despite the few shortcomings, there are several advantages of using Rust that more than outweigh any drawback.

In particular, Rust offers many features that make it easy to write optimized code that avoids unnecessary overhead and generates high-quality assembly code that modern CPUs can execute efficiently.

These features include parametric polymorphism, automatic memory management, closures, and a “zero-cost abstraction” that allows third-party crates to implement their own data structures, types, and other functionality without having to directly access or modify the Rust source code.

All of that makes it possible to write highly efficient code that is easy to maintain, which is a significant advantage over languages like C++ which have simpler syntax but more complicated semantics and lack first-class support for high-level abstractions.

Another key advantage of Rust is its excellent safety guarantees. In languages like C++, the compiler can’t verify that the programs it compiles are correct, which can lead to subtle bugs that can be difficult to track down.

In contrast, Rust provides a range of compile-time safety features that ensure that every program it compiles is error free. This makes it significantly easier to debug programs that in other languages would be very difficult to verify.

One of Rust’s great advantages is that it is fully open-source. This allows for easier inspection and customization of the coding language and libraries to meet the specific needs of any project.

This makes it well-suited to projects that require a customized runtime environment, such as game development and embedded systems. For these reasons, Rust has the potential to become a popular choice among game developers.

## Conclusion

Rust is a programming language that has gained a lot of traction in the development community in recent years. It offers developers an impressive set of advantages over traditional languages, including improved code safety, speed, and robustness.

Rust’s key selling points are its memory safety and its ability to run in any runtime environment. It also provides developers with the tools they need to create reliable and performant applications quickly and easily. With Rust, developers can write code that is both safe and efficient, making it an ideal choice for many types of projects.

The best resource to learn Rust by far has to be the official documentations. I know that a lot of programmers say the same thing about their favorite framework or language but I find Rust’s to be exceptionally good. You can start with “[the book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)” or go through the [course](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings/) exercises on GitHub. Alternatively, they offer you the [option](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/) to learn by doing.
